# Voice-Controlled-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot-v4.0-
This Voice-Controlled Obstacle Avoiding Car (v4.0) is an advanced robotics project designed to bridge the gap between autonomous navigation and human-machine interaction. Built on the Raspberry Pi platform, the system transforms a standard 4WD/2WD chassis into an intelligent explorer capable of processing auditory commands.
